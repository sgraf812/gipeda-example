# gipeda-example

A quite minimal (regarding scope) and maximal (regarding bisected dependencies) example of using cloben in conjunction with gipeda to produce a benchmark site for a specific commit of the Haskell pipes library.

The actual explaining comments are in `serveResults.sh`, which assumes that gipeda was built prior to executing this and that `stack` is installed for using cloben as a script.

See this as a documentary of how I got a feeling for how to use gipeda.
